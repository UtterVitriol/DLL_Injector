This program will inject a DLL into a target process using the CreateRemoteThread/LoadLibrary method.


## How to use
- Select a DLL using the "Select DLL" button.
- Highlight the target process by clicking on it in the process list. 
- "Inject"

If the target process was started after the Injector, you will need to click the "Refresh" button.
